# Student Decision Support System (DSS) API

A data-driven recommendation system for helping students find optimal university courses based on their preferences, budget constraints, and academic goals.

## Project Overview

The Student DSS is designed to simplify the process of finding suitable university programs globally. It matches student preferences with program data using a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers multiple factors:

- Academic fit
- Tuition costs
- Living expenses
- University rankings
- Career prospects
- Geographic preferences
- Language requirements

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- SQLite3
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-dss.git
   cd student-dss
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python data/initialize_database.py
   ```

5. Make sure the database file is located at `data/studentDSS.db` relative to the project root

## Database Structure

The system uses an SQLite database (`data/studentDSS.db`) with the following tables:

- **countries**: Information about countries including living costs and quality metrics
- **cities**: City-level data with population and cost of living
- **universities**: University details including rankings and locations
- **programs**: Academic program information with tuition and admission requirements
- **fields_of_study**: Information about academic disciplines and career prospects

Additionally, the system leverages student migration data from `data/student_migration_data.csv` to enhance recommendations based on patterns from previous student decisions.

## Running the API

Start the API server with:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker-compose up

# Or directly with Python
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Docker Configuration

The project includes Docker support for easy deployment and consistent environments.

### Docker Setup

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
2. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up
   ```
   
3. To run in detached mode:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. To stop the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Docker Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured in the `.env` file:

- `DB_PATH`: Path to the SQLite database (default: `./data/studentDSS.db`)
- `API_PORT`: Port for the API server (default: `5000`)
- `DEBUG_MODE`: Enable debug mode (default: `false`)

## Kubernetes Deployment

The project includes Kubernetes configuration for production deployment, providing scalability, high availability, and easier management of the application.

### Prerequisites for Kubernetes Deployment

- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, GKE, AKS, EKS)
- kubectl CLI configured to communicate with your cluster
- Docker image of the application pushed to a container registry

### Kubernetes Setup

1. Apply the Kubernetes configurations:
   ```bash
   # Create persistent volume claims for data and logs
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/pvc.yaml
   
   # Apply ConfigMap for environment variables
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/configmap.yaml
   
   # Deploy the application
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployment.yaml
   
   # Create the service
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/service.yaml
   
   # Set up horizontal pod autoscaling
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/hpa.yaml
   
   # Configure ingress (if using an ingress controller)
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/ingress.yaml
   ```

2. Verify the deployment:
   ```bash
   # Check deployment status
   kubectl get deployments
   
   # Check running pods
   kubectl get pods
   
   # Check services
   kubectl get services
   
   # Check persistent volume claims
   kubectl get pvc
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - When using Ingress, access via the configured domain (student-dss.example.com)
   - For testing, you can port-forward the service:
     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward svc/student-dss 8080:80
     ```
     Then access the application at http://localhost:8080

### Kubernetes Resources

The deployment uses the following Kubernetes resources:

- **Deployment**: Manages the application pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas are running
- **Service**: Exposes the application to the network
- **PersistentVolumeClaim**: Provides persistent storage for data and logs
- **ConfigMap**: Stores non-sensitive configuration data
- **HorizontalPodAutoscaler**: Automatically scales the number of pods based on CPU and memory usage
- **Ingress**: Configures external access to the services

### Scaling the Application

The application is configured with horizontal pod autoscaling:
- Minimum 2 replicas, maximum 10 replicas
- Scales up when CPU utilization exceeds 70% or memory utilization exceeds 80%

To manually scale the deployment:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment student-dss --replicas=5
```

### Monitoring and Logs

View logs from the application:
```bash
# Get pod names
kubectl get pods

# View logs for a specific pod
kubectl logs student-dss-pod-name

# Stream logs from a pod
kubectl logs -f student-dss-pod-name
```

## Base URL

All endpoints are relative to: `http://localhost:5000`
